##### A failed attempt to transform a public service through Design


CapQualif aims at modernising the title delivery query service for professional seafarers. Two priorities were define for this project. The first one aims at digitalising the query process for the seafarers and the administrators receiving those queries. The second aims at enabling the central administration to setup the automated rule that will be applied by the system to answers seaferers queries.
